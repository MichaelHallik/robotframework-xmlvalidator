<tr><td>06_advanced_validation_2.robot</td><td>26_Validation_With_Init_Schema</td><td>Validates that the schema as passed during library import is correctly loaded Subsequently validates various XML files (located in a folder) against the loaded schema Finally, validates that the keyword has correctly identified, collected and reported (returned) all errors that are to be expected and that, moreover, the errors have also been written to a CSV file</td></tr>

This will load a schema file that is located in that folder, provided there is only one such schema file present Since all XML files are valid, it is then only validated that the new schema has successfully replaced the previous schema</td></tr>
<tr><td>06_advanced_validation_2.robot</td><td>28_Various_Ways_To_Load_Schemas_02</td><td>Optionally validates that the schema (as active at the end of the previous test case) is (still) correctly loaded Subsequently validates various XML files (located in a folder), without expicitly passing an xsd_path. Rather, the XML files are mapped to their respective XSD files (located in the same folder) dynamically, by file name matching. The latter is triggered by passing the ``xsd_search_strategy`` argument as &#x27;by_filename&#x27; to the keyword, next to the XML folder path The results of the validation are subsequently thoroughly validated in terms of completeness and correctness Subsequently a second batch of XML files is validated in the same fashion. However, this time the XSD files reside in their own folder, different from the folder where the XML files are located Since all XML files are valid, only the correct setting schemas is validated</td></tr>
<tr><td>06_advanced_validation_2.robot</td><td>29_Various_Ways_To_Load_Schemas_03</td><td>Optionally validates that the schema (as active at the end of the previous test case) is (still) correctly loaded Subsequently validates various XML files (located in a folder), without expicitly passing an xsd_path. Rather, the XML files are mapped to their respective XSD files (located in the same folder) dynamically, by namespace matching. The latter is triggered by passing the ``xsd_search_strategy`` argument as &#x27;by_name_space&#x27; to the keyword, next to the XML folder path In total, 21 invalid files will be reported as invalid, either because of (1) XSD violation, (2) malformedness or (3) because of not matching any XSD Of the 21 errors that the library will identify, collect and report, only three will be validated for correctness. since there have been plenty validations throughout the various integration test suites already. You can inspect the log to see the various XSD violations and other types of errors that the library reports Bascially, there are three XSD files and for each XSD file there are three XML files that violate the XSD and three XML files that do not violate the schema, but are malformed. The latter will be catched and reported by the library as well! Finally, there are three XML files that do not match with any of the three schema files and will therefore be reported as such, by the library</td></tr>
<tr><td>06_advanced_validation_2.robot</td><td>30_Error_Facets</td><td>This test case passes custom (non-default) error facets to the Validate Xml Files keywords Error facets determine which attributes of a parse error or an XmlSchema (validation) error are collected and reported by the keyword Error facets can also be passed during library import. Passing error facets to the keyword overrules these default facets. However, the next time the keyword ios called without passing error_facets, the default facets apply again The validations errors that are reported/returned in this test case will not be validated. Instead, each error is logged, including the data type of the error facet (e.g. string or xml.etree.ElementTree.Element)</td></tr>
<tr><td>06_advanced_validation_2.robot</td><td>31_Validation_Passing_XSD_Path_With_Include</td><td>Validate multiple XML files against an XSD with an included XSD This ensures that XSD imports/includes are correctly handled The Validate Xml Keyword will validate three XML files against the loaded schema: - one file will be deemed valid - one file will be deemed invalid on account of violating the main XSD schema - one file will be deemed invalid on account of violating the included XSD schema</td></tr>
